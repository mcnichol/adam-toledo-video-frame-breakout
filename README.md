# Adam Toledo Shooting (2021-03-29) - Chicago COPA
The unedited video was downloaded from: https://vimeo.com/536331629 

The video in this repo is 320p due to file size restrictions with GH. If you would like to have a higher quality video to create frames from, visit the Vimeo link and download the resolution you would prefer. Place the downloaded file in the root directory of this folder overwriting the exist video. If you change the name of the file you must also change it in the toledo-frames.py script.  

Although the video in Vimeo is a great resource, when stepping forward it steps at 2 frames per increment. This is an issue because the bodycam is 30FPS. By downloading and breaking out a video into it's subsequent frames you can step through (as a video is only a series of images played in succession). The frames that are in this repo are from Frame #03500 - #03799. There are likely many more significant events so feel free to have them added, these are the frames that capture the events listed in the timeline below.  All frames can be generated from the bodycam by following the python usage instructions below.  

I feel it is important that we show this despite the graphic nature of its unedited form to ensure there is no ambiguity when discussing what happened. My goal is to make this purely factual without opinions or bias. If you can't hear it or see it in the frame or on the video then this isn't the place. This is a tragedy regardless the outcome and by being factual and precise we have a chance to speak clearly and hopefully understand what happened so we can improve and prevent any future tragedies.  I have no stake in this video other than waiting to show people how to get a frame-by-frame breakdown of a video using python so they can verify for themselves and hopefully helping us work towards ways that eliminate these tragedies as nobody wants to see their child shot and I truly believe no police officer wants to shoot a child. I don't plan on sharing my opinion beyond providing descriptions on frames that appear to explain what I see which appear as significant events.  There are likely many that others will feel are significant so I encourage you to submit a PR (click edit file on the readme) and I will pull them in.  Please provide the data in the format below under Significant frames.  Insert them in a linear format.

# Timing
* (02:38:23) +00 seconds - LEO exited vehicle and begins foot pursuit of Adam Toledo 
* (02:38:34) +11 seconds - Turned on audio 
* (02:38:36) +02 seconds - Turned on strobe light
* (02:38:38) +02 seconds - Says the word "Hands" and begins the sentence "Show me your fucking hands" as Adam Toledo stops at a gap in the wooden face in order to throw a gun off his person.
* (02:38:39) +01 seconds - LEO yells "Drop" or "Stop" and has visibility of a gun in right hand of Adam Toledo
* (02:38:40) +01 seconds - LEO fires service pistol into Adam Toledos chest. Adam Toledos hands are at head level and does not have the gun in his right hand. It appears he threw it behind an opening in the fence.
* (02:38:42) +02 seconds - Adam Toledo falls to the ground clutching his chest
* (02:38:44) +02 seconds - LEO calls in shots fired and calls for ambulance
* (02:38:49) +05 seconds - LEO is kneeling over Adam Toledo telling him to "look at me", asks him if he is okay. Drops gear and begins looking for wound.
* (02:38:56) +07 seconds - Paramedic arrives


# Future Improvements
* **Wide angle lens for bodycams:** It is unrealistic that LEO would ensure that a suspect is visible to the bodycam at all times. Having a wider angle (or fish-eye) lens could potentially expand the lens to capture a wider view although this could potentially introduce unwanted distorting in excess of what exists. For events like this where there is an extremely short number of frames between the time LEO catches up to Adam Toledo, see's a handgun, and discharges his service weapon the handgun in Adam Toledos right hand can only be seen in 2 frames. It may have been visible for longer but was off screen.
* **Higher Resolution:** If feasible a higher resolution could provide more clarity as this appears to be 720p
* **Higher Framerate:** Bodycam appears to be 30fps. Having 60fps would aid in reducing motion blur and providing more twice as many frames in cases where there is very little information to work from.
